        <h3>Backstory</h3>
        <p><strong>Arroz Caldo</strong>, commonly confused with 'Lugaw' is a Filipino rice based dish. Both are made
            with chicken and ginger. The key difference is the consistency. Lugaw is more porridge-like, while Arroz Caldo is soupier.
            Arroz Caldo is usually served with a side of boiled egg and green onions, while Lugaw is not.
        </p>
        <p>It is served as comfort food in Philippine culture and is a popular breakfast meal. The name is derived from Spanish <em>'arroz'</em>, meaning rice and
            <em>'caldo'</em>, meaning broth.
        </p>
        <p>Despite its Spanish name, it has origins from the <em>congee</em> introduced by Chinese-Filipino migrants, diverging over centuries to use Filipino ingredients
            and to suit the local tastes.
